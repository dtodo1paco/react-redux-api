# react-redux-api
Simple app using React and Redux with an API call to initialize data

![demo](https://github.com/dtodo1paco/react-redux-api/raw/master/screenshots/demo.gif)

* List on the left is initialized using an API call (see src/components/ItemList.jsx:componentWillMount)
* List on the right works with user input in a Form

Both uses redux paradigm with react.

Based on [Valentinogagliardi's example](https://github.com/valentinogagliardi/webpack-4-quickstart) combined with [stowball article](https://medium.com/@stowball/a-dummys-guide-to-redux-and-thunk-in-react-d8904a7005d3)
